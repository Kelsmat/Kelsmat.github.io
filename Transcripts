My name is Kelsey Mathews. I attended Terry High School and graduated at number 25 out of 320 in my class with a 4.0 gpa. I was the leader in almost every extracurricular activity I have ever participated in. I received a full Presidential Scholarship to Tougaloo College, where I will be attending in the fall of 2016. I am a very ambitious and consistent person. I can say about myself is that I will never give up. I always stick up for what I believe in. No matter what the situation I will stand for what I know is right. I voice my opinion when needed. In the near future, I plan to finish college at the top of my class. After that, I plan to attend medical school and pursue my career. I love to chase my dreams. Ever since I was a little girl, I write out my dreams and goals. I can honestly say that there is not one on my list that has not been fulfilled.
